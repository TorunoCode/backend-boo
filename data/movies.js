        "Myeong-hye and Hyun-min move to the countryside with their three kids due to a financial problem. Their new house seems great on the outside but it feels somewhat ominous at the same. On the first day at the new house, Myeong-hye feels unsettling energy and struggles with a nightmare. Moreover, she keeps hearing the strange sound from the shed next to the house, which is locked up tightly. While Myeong-hye is concerned about all incidents that have happened at home, Hyun-min just brushes her off. In the midst of the parents' conflict, three kids grow anxious. Slowly driven crazy by the unknown strange sound, Myeong-hye meets a suspicious neighbor Eun-young, who tells her that the house is 'contorted'. With nightmares growing worse each day, the family finally faces a secret buried deep within their home.",
